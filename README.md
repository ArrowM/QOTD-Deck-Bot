## About

The QOTD (Question of the Day) Deck Bot allows server members to engage with questions posted automatically from various "decks" (collections of questions). Users can create and manage these decks, add questions, and subscribe channels to receive questions based on a cron schedule.

## Permissions

*   **General Commands:** Usable by everyone.
*   **Modification Commands:** Require the user to have **Administrator** permission OR a role that has been granted privileged access via the `/role-add` command.
*   **Permission Management Commands:** Require the user to have **Administrator** permission.

## How It Works

1.  **Create a Deck:** Use `/deck-create` to make a new collection for your questions.
    *   Example: `/deck-create name:"Team Trivia" description:"Weekly trivia questions"`
2.  **Add Questions:** Populate your deck using `/question-add` for individual questions or `/deck-replace` to add many at once.
    *   Example: `/question-add deck:"Team Trivia" question:"What is the capital of France?"`
    *   Example: `/deck-replace name:"Team Trivia" all_questions:"What is 2+2?? Who painted the Mona Lisa?"`
3.  **Subscribe a Channel:** Use `/subscribe` to set up automatic question posting in the current channel.
    *   You'll provide the decks to use and a **schedule**.
    *   Example: `/subscribe schedule:"0 10 * * MON-FRI"` (This means "At 10:00 AM, Monday through Friday")
    *   You will then be prompted to select one or more decks for this subscription.
4.  **Automatic Posting:** The bot will post questions from the subscribed decks according to the schedule. It cycles through questions in order for each subscribed deck. If multiple decks are subscribed, it will post one question from one deck, then the next time from the next deck in the cycle, and so on.
